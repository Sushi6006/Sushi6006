### Hi there, I'm Sushi6006 👋

<!--**Sushi6006/Sushi6006** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I am Leyan (Terry) Lin (林乐研) and I go by `Sushi6006` or `SushiCat` on the Internet as you can probably already tell. If you can't, you're so blind go see a doctor.

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne studying Computing and Software Systems (Computer Science).
